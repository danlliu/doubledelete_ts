# doubledelete.ts

A TypeScript Discord bot framework, made to simplify slash command and interaction management.

## Why doubledelete.ts?

I wanted to create a framework that seamlessly manages slash commands, without weird file system dependencies. Additionally, I wanted to easily support stateful operations by adding database integration.

## Usage

Clone down this repository, and then modify the [`/commands`](commands/) directory to add your commands!
